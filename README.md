# Quad Four

**Context:** School Project for _Enterprise Application Development_ (University of Cincinnati - Spring 2020)

**Collaborators:** Joe Boylson, Aaron Zorzi, Hunter Holland 

**Project Synopsis:**

Quad Four is a productivity application that aims to use Stephen Covey's "Four Quadrant" system, which prompts the user to categorize a task by urgency (urgent/not urgent) and importance (important/not important).

In this way, the user is easily able to prioritize their tasks, getting the most important and the most urgent tasks completed first.
